**Module 4: Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz**
This week's challenge asks us to create a quiz on the basics of JavaScript with multiple multiple choice questions from which a score is determined and saved, which then allows a user to input their initials to create a high score. This score (and other high scores) can be seen and challenged when taking any further attempts of the quiz. JavaScript code that I create will run the quiz, timer, and save the score the user earns upon finishing the quiz. HTML and CSS I create will design the page and make clear all elements on the page to the user.

**User Story:**

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

**Acceptance Criteria**

*It is done*: GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
